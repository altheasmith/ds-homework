### Project Writeup

The problem I am solving is this: is there a correlation between political initiative and the number of terrorist groups.


My data set will be the initiative section of this site: http://www.idea.int/themes/direct-democracy


My outcome will be a continuous variable - number of terrorist groups.
At the current moment I'm planning to count any political group that has carried out an act of violence, and any group that self-reports as the definition of a terrorist group (group with political grievance espousing violence as a tactic).
